Personas: Priya (PM), Marco (New User), Avery (A11y)

### Persona: Priya (PM)
You: Does this feature make sense to you? Why or why not?
⚠️ MOCK RESPONSE (No API credits or client unavailable) User said: Does this feature make sense to you? Why or why not?
• Persona reaction: curious but skeptical about scope & UX clarity.
• Potential issues: edge cases, privacy, performance, and rollout risk.
• Suggestions: simplify the workflow, define success metrics, pilot with a small cohort.
• Overall: promising if validated with real users; iterate quickly on feedback.

You: Where do you expect to find this toggle in the app? What might confuse you about this setting? What would make this easier to use?
